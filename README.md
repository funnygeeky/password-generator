Homework 3 - JavaScript Password Generator

The password generator prompts the user to choose a password length and confirm by clicking ok or deny by clicking cancel the following additional password criteria:
1. Use lowercase letters in the password
2. Use uppercase letters in the password
3. User numbers in the password
4. Use symbols in the password

Functions math.random and math.floor will be used to select the characters from arrays of data.

An event listener will detect when the "Generate Password" button has been clicked after all the user inputs have been entered from prompts.
